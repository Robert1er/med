    <h1>What Happens When Operators Build Platforms?</h1>

    <p>Operators prepare for the worst, design for the future, and eliminate opportunities for failure early on.</p>

    <p>Last month, we launched Baton Health and were excited to see hundreds of new users sign up, mostly on our free accounts. We love getting questions in the chat about optimizing the product, our growth plans, and suggestions for new features.</p>

    <p>But nothing could prepare us for what happened next: an unprecedented surge in signups—100,000 users, then 200,000, then 300,000. At first, it felt like we'd hit a major milestone. But something wasn’t right.</p>

    <p>These weren’t real users. Baton Health was under attack.</p>

    <h2>The Test We Didn’t Expect—But Were Ready For</h2>

    <p>Our system was suddenly flooded with automated signups at a scale we'd never seen. The sheer volume was staggering—more user registrations per minute than in our entire existence.</p>

    <p>Despite the onslaught, our team remained composed. In fact, we were almost flattered. Someone, somewhere, had identified Baton as a valuable repository of information. We couldn’t agree more.</p>

    <p>Within moments, we detected, isolated, and eliminated the threat. Our infrastructure absorbed the attack without failure, and because we built Baton with visibility into every exposed surface, our team responded swiftly and decisively.</p>

    <p>This wasn’t luck. It was preparation.</p>

    <h2>Built for Resilience</h2>

    <p>As an operator, I always try to anticipate challenges and design solutions that withstand unforeseen events. The recent attack was a real-world test of our platform’s resilience—and we passed.</p>

    <p>A major factor in our response was our preparation for <strong>SOC 2 compliance</strong>, which is a key milestone as we work toward major partnerships. This effort ensured our security protocols, monitoring systems, and infrastructure were hardened well before the attack occurred.</p>

    <p>SOC 2 isn’t just about checking a compliance box. It’s about trust—giving our users and partners confidence that Baton Health can withstand pressure, whether from bad actors or rapid growth.</p>

    <h2>Balancing Self-Service and Security</h2>

    <p>Our infrastructure is designed for <strong>self-service signups</strong>, ensuring small practices can access our platform without friction. We believe in democratizing credentialing tools for organizations that often lack the resources for expensive, enterprise-level solutions.</p>

    <p>But with that openness comes risk. Malicious actors exploited our signup process to test our defenses, but careful planning ensured they never accessed anything beyond <strong>publicly available data</strong>.</p>

    <p>Security and accessibility aren’t opposing forces—they’re design constraints that must be balanced. The attack reinforced that our approach is working: Baton is open to legitimate users, closed to threats, and scalable for the future.</p>

    <h2>The Team That Made It Happen</h2>

    <p>This wasn’t just a stress test for our platform—it was a testament to our people.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jahsa Coleman, Chief of Staff, and Sam Gross, Director of Product</strong>, led the charge in designing our security posture and implementing SOC 2 standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Vivek Poola and Tuna Ozerdem, our application engineers</strong>, swiftly identified the bad actors and fortified our defenses in real-time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I had the easy job—watching as our team executed flawlessly, knowing that the systems we built together were working exactly as intended.</p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

    <p>Someday, we <em>will</em> see 300,000 real users signing up. Until then, we’ll keep solving one of healthcare’s longest-standing problems—ensuring providers can access the credentialing data they need, securely and seamlessly.</p>

    <p>Because when operators build platforms, they don’t just plan for success. They plan for everything.</p>
