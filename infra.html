                <p>Healthcare’s most impactful systems often go unnoticed. Behind every patient visit, insurance claim, and prescription is critical infrastructure that keeps the industry running. Electronic health records (EHRs), claims processing platforms, and e-prescribing networks are more than software—they’re essential utilities that healthcare organizations rely on daily.</p>

                <p>But one essential system has been left behind: credentialing.</p>
                
                <h2>The $20B Bottleneck Holding Healthcare Back</h2>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Before any provider in the U.S. can work at a hospital, bill an insurer, or join a provider network, they must be credentialed. This process involves primary source verification (PSV)—confirming licenses, certifications, and training history.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>This fragmented process delays provider onboarding by months.</li>
                    <li>It costs the industry billions in administrative waste.</li>
                    <li>It slows down healthcare delivery.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>With the rise of virtual care, cross-state licensing, and value-based care models, these inefficiencies are no longer just frustrating—they’re a fundamental barrier to progress.</p>
                
                <h2>Why Credentialing Needs Shared Infrastructure</h2>
                
                <p>Credentialing has always been treated as an isolated task that each organization must handle independently. The result? Duplicate work, delays, and outdated records. Even when a provider is credentialed at one hospital, they must start the process all over again when applying to another.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Baton Health is changing that.</strong> We’ve built a system that federates data from hundreds of primary sources and makes it accessible in real time. Each verification performed through our platform enriches the dataset, reducing redundant work across the entire industry.</p>
                
                <h2>Technology Built to Scale—Not Patchwork Solutions</h2>
                
                <p>Traditional credentialing processes rely on PDFs, faxed forms, and outdated databases that require constant manual updates. Even modern credentialing software often just digitizes the paperwork without addressing the core issue: duplication.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Baton Health automates verification processes.</li>
                    <li>Our system continuously updates provider credentials as new data becomes available.</li>
                    <li>This ensures that every organization using Baton works with accurate, verified information.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>A Critical Moment for Healthcare Infrastructure</h2>
                
                <p>Healthcare is evolving rapidly. Without scalable verification infrastructure, everything from provider onboarding to telehealth expansion slows to a crawl.</p>
                
                <h2>Why This Matters for Investors</h2>
                
                <p>The most successful healthcare infrastructure companies—EHRs, claims processors, and e-prescribing networks—share one key trait: they became indispensable. Baton Health is on the same trajectory.</p>
                
                <p>We’re raising capital to scale our infrastructure and meet the growing demand for a faster, smarter credentialing system. If you’re an investor looking to support the future of healthcare infrastructure, we’d love to connect.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Baton Health is building what credentialing should have been all along—and we’re just getting started.</strong></p>            </section>
